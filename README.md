# Linux System Audit Script

A small but practical Bash-based tool for auditing basic Linux system state.
Built as a learning project with a focus on **shell scripting, system inspection, and DevOps-style thinking**.

Tested on **Ubuntu 20.04**.

---

## 📌 What this project does

The script performs a lightweight system audit and outputs structured information about:

* Disk usage
* Memory usage
* Active users

This is **not a monitoring system**.
It is a controlled audit script designed to be:

* predictable
* readable
* safe to run
* easy to understand and extend

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Command-line arguments (`--disk`, `--memory`, `--users`, `--all`)
* Modular Bash functions
* Argument validation
* Conditional execution of checks
* Structured logging to a file
* Signal handling using `trap`
* Output redirection support (`stdout`, `stderr`)
* Data parsing with `awk`

## 🚀 Usage

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x sys_audit.sh
```

Run specific checks:

```bash
./sys_audit.sh --disk
./sys_audit.sh --memory
./sys_audit.sh --users
```

Run all checks:

```bash
./sys_audit.sh --all
```

Show help:

```bash
./sys_audit.sh --help
```

---

## 📂 Logging

The script writes logs to a file inside the `logs/` directory.

Example:

```bash
./sys_audit.sh --all
```

Log file example content:

```
[2025-.. ..:..:..] [INFO] Disk usage is OK: 58%
[2025-.. ..:..:..] [INFO] Memory usage is OK: 8%
[2025-.. ..:..:..] [INFO] Active user: pchelbisson
```

## 🧠 Why this project

This project was built to practice:

* Writing maintainable Bash scripts
* Using functions, conditions, and loops in real tasks
* Thinking in terms of **inputs → processing → output**
* Handling script termination gracefully
* Understanding how simple system audit tools are structured

---

## 📎 Notes

* Designed for Linux systems
* Not intended for production monitoring
* Focused on learning and clarity rather than feature completeness
